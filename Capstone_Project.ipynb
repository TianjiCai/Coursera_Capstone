    "This project aims to build a __recommendation system__ that helps people find the most home-like neighborhoods in a new city. In this notebook, I will use myself as an example and try to look for neighborhoods in __New York and San Francisco__ that are most similar to my hometown in __Shanghai__. Venues around a neighborhood will be obtained from __Foursquare__ and will then be used to construct a feature set which characterizes that particular neighborhood. Afterwards, different neighborhoods in the new cities will be compared to one's hometown based on their respective feature sets, and those that share most similarities with the hometown will be recommended to the customer and get marked on an __interactive Folium map__. From the total number of recommended neighborhoods in a particular city, one can also see which city on the whole most resembles someone's hometown, at least as far as living is concerned. In the case studied here, we will see whether it is New York or San Francisco that is most similar to Shanghai.   \n",

    "As the saying goes, _EAST OR WEST, HOME THE BEST_. After spending years moving from one city to another, I'm often stroke by nostalgia and always wish to find a living place that resembles my childhood home. Given that nowadays globalization has made people much more mobile than ever before, finding a second home in a foreign city that we truly feel comfortable with is likely to become a greater concern for a growing number of young people around the world. Yet, it is no easy task, especially for someone who has to remotely sign an online leasing contract before even visiting the city. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the place where I think data science can help. Utilizing the vast amount of location and venue information available online, if we can somehow build a feature set for every neighborhood in the cities concerned, we can then use these feature sets to compare different neighborhoods with the customer's hometown (or any other neighborhood he/she picks) and come up with the top neighborhoods that most resemble one's hometown. The result can aid our customers to make a well-informed choice in deciding where to live. \n",

    "As said in the _Introduction_, I will use myself as an example for this project. As a child, I lived in a district called __Hongkou__ in __Shanghai, China__, which used to be a cultural center and is located not far from the commercial heart of Shanghai. It is a nice place to live and I will use the neighborhoods in this district/borough as a benchmark in my search for a second home far far away on the other side of the globe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since I'm an aspiring data scientist, the next city that I might move into will probably be a hub for data science. I decided to pick one city from the east coast of US and one from the west coast, hoping that this will enable me to make a crude comparison of the two coasts in addition to my neighborhood analysis. The two cities chosen in this study are __New York and San Francisco__. __The main objective is to recommend a total number of 20 neighborhoods in these two cities__. From the recommendation, we can also learn which city has the largested number of recommended neighborhoods, thus most similar to my hometown in Shanghai. \n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing your right neighborhood is a daunting task. Therefore, the anaylsis done here will be interesting to anyone who plans to move into a new city, yet is at a loss in the process of finding a new place to call home.\n",

The data downloaded from their csv/json file is not very organized and I need to clean them before the anaylsis. In addition, since the data was originally collected in 2010, it might not be most up-to-date and by comparing it with the [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_in_San_Francisco), I did find some discrepancies.
